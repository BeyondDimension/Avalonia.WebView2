Memory Leak Tests
-----------------

These tests use JetBrains' dotMemory Unit. When run in a normal test runner, they will always pass.

To run the tests, you need to have dotMemory/ReSharper and install the XUnit plugin. You should 
then be able to run the tests using Resharper -> Unit Tests -> Run all tests from solution under
dotMemory Unit.
